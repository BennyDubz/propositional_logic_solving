# Propositional Logic Solving

Implementaion of SAT and WALKSAT algorithms to find solutions to many propositional logic clauses. Designed to solve Sudoku puzzles (though the Sudoku code was created by Dartmouth, not me). `SATExtra.py` includes additional handling of constants. Testing, results, and discussion (especially for the effectiveness of actually using constants) can be seen in the `report.md` or the PDF version. 

Testing can be done using `solve_sudoku.py`.
